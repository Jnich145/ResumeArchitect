# ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: READ BEFORE PROCEEDING ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Pre-Development Checklist

Before beginning any development work on ResumeArchitect, complete the following steps:

1. **Review the entire build.log** to understand what has already been implemented
   - Check which sprints have been completed
   - Note any ongoing issues or technical debt
   - Understand recent changes and optimizations

2. **Analyze the entire codebase**
   - Examine ALL directories and files to gain a comprehensive understanding
   - Check for redundant implementations and unused components
   - Understand the architecture: frontend services call backend endpoints
   - Note the separation between client-side and server-side code

3. **Check for inconsistencies**
   - Look for features referenced in the UI but not fully implemented
   - Identify any potential tech debt (like the academic template reference without implementation)
   - Verify that all imports are properly used

4. **Document your findings before making changes**
   - Create a plan that builds on the existing work rather than duplicating effort
   - When fixing issues, ensure you're not creating work that's already been done

Skipping these steps has previously resulted in:
- Duplicate implementation of features
- Misunderstanding of the project architecture
- Wasted development time
- Inconsistent code patterns

## üöß Immediate Task Priorities (Sprint 1 ‚Äì Core Fixes)

### Resume Builder Functionality
- [ ] Implement accurate PDF export with dimensions that match preview
- [ ] Fix save functionality so all resume sections persist properly
- [ ] Add validation for all input fields (required, formats)
- [ ] Add auto-save with visual feedback
- [ ] Fix preview scaling and template render issues

### Templates
- [ ] Fix SVG loading and template switching
- [ ] Add error boundaries around rendering
- [ ] Implement remaining templates: Creative, Professional, etc.

---

## üîê Sprint 2 ‚Äì Authentication & Security

### Frontend
- [ ] Replace localStorage with HttpOnly cookies
- [ ] Implement route protection for authenticated pages

### Backend
- [ ] Add JWT validation, CSRF protection, and role-based access
- [ ] Add secure password reset flow and email confirmations

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Sprint 3 ‚Äì Data Models & API

- [ ] Create `User`, `Resume`, and `Template` models
- [ ] Implement versioning and autosave logic in resume schema
- [ ] Create CRUD endpoints for resume data
- [ ] Integrate Stripe for subscription tiers and trial periods

---

## ü§ñ Sprint 4 ‚Äì AI Integration & Analytics

- [ ] Connect to OpenAI API for resume suggestions
- [ ] Implement ATS scoring system
- [ ] Create dashboard for resume performance analytics

---

## üíé Sprint 5 ‚Äì UI/UX, Performance & Testing

- [ ] Add responsive design polish and accessibility features
- [ ] Implement dark mode and high-contrast toggle
- [ ] Set up Jest + Cypress for critical path tests
- [ ] Deploy to staging with CI/CD via Vercel or Netlify

---

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- Frontend: React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
- Backend: Node.js + Express/Fastify
- DB: PostgreSQL or MongoDB (agent selects)
- State: Zustand or Redux Toolkit
- PDF: Puppeteer or html2pdf
- AI: OpenAI (gpt-4 or 3.5-turbo)
- Auth: JWT with refresh tokens and secure cookies
- Payment: Stripe
- DevOps: Docker + GitHub Actions + Vercel

---

## üßæ Execution Constraints

- No user input will be available during the build
- Must auto-resolve blocking errors and retry if needed
- Must write all logs to `build.log`
- Must commit progress incrementally
- Must aim for full feature parity and security best practices

---

## ‚úÖ Done When:

- Users can register, log in, and build/resume a resume
- Multiple templates render and export cleanly
- PDF export is pixel-perfect
- AI features are functional
- Payments work with Stripe
- App is deployed and documented
